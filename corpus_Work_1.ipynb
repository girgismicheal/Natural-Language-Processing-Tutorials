K. C.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I\\n\\nTHE TWO POETS OF SAFFRON PARK\\n\\nTHE suburb of Saffron Park lay on the sunset side of London, as\\nred and ragged as a cloud of sunset.It was built of a bright\\nbrick throughout; its sky-line was fantastic, and even its ground\\nplan was wild.It had been the outburst of a speculative builder,\\nfaintly tinged with art, who called its architecture sometimes\\nElizabethan and sometimes Queen Anne, apparently under the\\nimpression that the two sovereigns were identical.It was described\\nwith some justice as an artistic colony, though it never in any\\ndefinable way produced any art.', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('But although its pretensions to be\\nan intellectual centre were a little vague, its pretensions to be a\\npleasant place were quite indisputable.The stranger who looked for\\nthe first time at the quaint red houses could only think how very\\noddly shaped the people must be who could fit in to them.Nor when\\nhe met the people was he disappointed in this respect.The place\\nwas not only pleasant, but perfect, if once he could regard it not\\nas a deception but rather as a dream.Even if the people were not\\n\"artists,\" the whole was nevertheless artistic.', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('That young man with\\nthe long, auburn hair and the impudent face--that young man was not\\nreally a poet; but surely he was a poem.That old gentleman with\\nthe wild, white beard and the wild, white hat--that venerable\\nhumbug was not really a philosopher; but at least he was the cause\\nof philosophy in others.That scientific gentleman with the bald,\\negg-like head and the bare, bird-like neck had no real right to the\\nairs of science that he assumed.He had not discovered anything new\\nin biology; but what biological creature could he have discovered\\nmore singular than himself?Thus, and thus only, the whole place\\nhad properly to be regarded; it had to be considered not so much\\nas a workshop for artists, but as a frail but finished work of art.', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('A man who stepped into its social atmosphere felt as if he had\\nstepped into a written comedy.More especially this attractive unreality fell upon it about\\nnightfall, when the extravagant roofs were dark against the\\nafterglow and the whole insane village seemed as separate as a\\ndrifting cloud.This again was more strongly true of the many\\nnights of local festivity, when the little gardens were often\\nilluminated, and the big Chinese lanterns glowed in the dwarfish\\ntrees like some fierce and monstrous fruit.And this was strongest\\nof all on one particular evening, still vaguely remembered in the\\nlocality, of which the auburn-haired poet was the hero.It was not\\nby any means the only evening of which he was the hero.', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('On many\\nnights those passing by his little back garden might hear his high,\\ndidactic voice laying down the law to men and particularly to\\nwomen.The attitude of women in such cases was indeed one of the\\nparadoxes of the place.Most of the women were of the kind vaguely\\ncalled emancipated, and professed some protest against male\\nsupremacy.Yet these new women would always pay to a man the\\nextravagant compliment which no ordinary woman ever pays to him,\\nthat of listening while he is talking.And Mr. Lucian Gregory, the\\nred-haired poet, was really (in some sense) a man worth listening\\nto, even if one only laughed at the end of it.', 'chesterton-thursday')], [(\"He put the old cant\\nof the lawlessness of art and the art of lawlessness with a certain\\nimpudent freshness which gave at least a momentary pleasure.He was\\nhelped in some degree by the arresting oddity of his appearance,\\nwhich he worked, as the phrase goes, for all it was worth.His dark\\nred hair parted in the middle was literally like a woman's, and\\ncurved into the slow curls of a virgin in a pre-Raphaelite picture.From within this almost saintly oval, however, his face projected\\nsuddenly broad and brutal, the chin carried forward with a look of\\ncockney contempt.This combination at once tickled and terrified\\nthe nerves of a neurotic population.\", 'chesterton-thursday')], [('He seemed like a walking\\nblasphemy, a blend of the angel and the ape.This particular evening, if it

you could only say that the sky\\nwas full of feathers, and of feathers that almost brushed the\\nface.Across the great part of the dome they were grey, with the\\nstrangest tints of violet and mauve

good to be seen.', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('The whole\\nwas so close about the earth, as to express nothing but a violent\\nsecrecy.The very empyrean seemed to be a secret.It expressed\\nthat

TALE OF A DETECTIVE\\n\\nGABRIEL SYME was not merely a detective who pretended to be a poet;\\nhe was really a poet who had become a detective.Nor was his hatred\\nof anarchy hypocritical.He was one of those who are driven early\\nin life into too conservative an attitude by the bewildering folly\\nof most revolutionists.', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('He had not attained it by any tame\\ntradition.His respectability was spontaneous and sudden, a\\nrebellion against rebellion.He came of a family of cranks, in\\nwhich all the oldest people had all the newest notions.One of his\\nuncles always walked about without a hat, and another had made an\\nunsuccessful attempt to walk about with a hat and nothing else.His\\nfather cultivated art and self-realisation; his mother went in for\\nsimplicity and hygiene.', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('Hence the child, during his tenderer years,\\nwas wholly unacquainted with any drink between the extremes of\\nabsinth and cocoa, of both of which he had a healthy dislike.The\\nmore his mother preached a more than Puritan abstinence the more\\ndid his father expand into a more than pagan latitude; and by the\\ntime the former had come to enforcing vegetarianism, the latter had\\npretty well reached the point of defending cannibalism.Being surrounded with every conceivable kind of revolt from\\ninfancy, Gabriel had to revolt into something, so he revolted into\\nthe only thing left--sanity.But there was just enough in him of\\nthe blood of these fanatics to make even his protest for common\\nsense a little too fierce to be sensible.His hatred of modern\\nlawlessness had been crowned also by an accident.', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('It happened that\\nhe was walking in a side street at the instant of a dynamite\\noutrage.He had been blind and deaf for a moment, and then seen,\\nthe smoke clearing, the broken windows and the bleeding faces.After that he went about as usual--quiet, courteous, rather gentle;\\nbut there was a spot on his mind that was not sane.He did not\\nregard anarchists, as most of us do, as a handful of morbid men,\\ncombining ignorance with intellectualism.He regarded them as a\\nhuge and pitiless peril, like a Chinese invasion.', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('He poured perpetually into newspapers and their waste-paper baskets\\na torrent of tales, verses and violent articles, warning men of\\nthis deluge of barbaric denial.But he seemed to be getting no\\nnearer his enemy, and, what was worse, no nearer a living.As he\\npaced the Thames embankment, bitterly biting a cheap cigar and\\nbrooding on the advance of Anarchy, there was no anarchist with\\na bomb in his pocket so savage or so solitary as he.Indeed, he\\nalways felt that Government stood alone and desperate, with its\\nback to the wall.He was too quixotic to have cared for it\\notherwise.', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('He walked on the Embankment once under a dark red sunset.The red\\nriver reflected the red sky, and they both reflected his anger.The\\nsky, indeed, was so swarthy, and the light on the river relatively\\nso lurid, that the water almost seemed of fiercer flame than the\\nsunset it mirrored.It looked like a stream of literal fire winding\\nunder the vast caverns of a subterranean country.Syme was shabby in those days.', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('He wore an old-fashioned black\\nchimney-pot hat; he was wrapped in a yet more old-fashioned cloak,\\nblack and ragged; and the combination gave him the look of the\\nearly villains in Dickens and Bulwer

Soho for twopence, stood out from\\nbetween his tightened teeth, and altogether he looked a very\\nsatisfactory specimen of the anarchists upon whom he had vowed a\\nholy war.Perhaps this was why a policeman on the Embankment spoke\\nto him, and said \"Good evening.\"Syme, at a crisis of his morbid fears for humanity, seemed stung by\\nthe mere stolidity of the automatic official, a mere bulk of

the\\nofficials and ambassadors of a great king.', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('There were no less than\\nsix carriages waiting, one for each of the tattered and miserable\\nband.All the attendants (as

separated.\"Is\\nthis another joke of Sunday\\'s?\"', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('\"I don\\'t know,\" said Syme as he sank wearily back in the cushions\\nof his carriage; \"but if it is, it\\'s one of the jokes you talk\\nabout.It\\'s a good-natured one.\"The six adventurers had passed through many adventures, but not one\\nhad carried them so utterly off their feet as this last adventure\\nof comfort.They had all become inured to things going roughly; but\\nthings suddenly going smoothly swamped them.They could not even\\nfeebly imagine what the carriages were; it was enough for them to\\nknow that they were carriages, and carriages with cushions.', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('They\\ncould not conceive who the old man was who had led them; but it was\\nquite enough that he had certainly led them to the carriages.Syme drove through a drifting darkness of trees in utter\\nabandonment.It was typical of him that while he had carried his\\nbearded chin forward fiercely so long as anything could be done,\\nwhen the whole business was taken out of his hands he fell back\\non the cushions in a frank collapse.Very gradually and very vaguely he realised into what rich roads\\nthe carriage was carrying him.He saw that they passed the stone\\ngates of what might have been a park, that they began gradually to\\nclimb a hill which, while wooded on both sides, was somewhat more\\norderly than a forest.', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('Then there began to grow upon him, as upon a\\nman slowly waking from a healthy sleep, a pleasure in everything.He felt that the hedges were what hedges should be, living walls;\\nthat a hedge is like a human army, disciplined, but all the more\\nalive.He saw high elms behind the hedges, and vaguely thought how\\nhappy boys would be climbing there.Then his carriage took a turn\\nof the path, and he saw suddenly and quietly, like a long, low,\\nsunset cloud, a long, low house, mellow in the mild light of\\nsunset.All the six friends compared notes afterwards and\\nquarrelled; but they all agreed that in some unaccountable way the\\nplace reminded them of their boyhood.', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('It was either this elm-top\\nor that crooked path, it was either this scrap of orchard or that\\nshape of a window; but each man of them declared that he could\\nremember this place before he could remember his mother.When the carriages eventually rolled up to a large, low, cavernous\\ngateway, another man in the same uniform, but wearing a silver star\\non the grey breast of his coat, came out to meet them.This\\nimpressive person said to the bewildered Syme--\\n\\n\"Refreshments are provided for you in your room.\"Syme, under the influence of the same mesmeric sleep of amazement,\\nwent up the large oaken stairs after the respectful attendant.He\\nentered a splendid suite of apartments that seemed to be designed\\nspecially for him.', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('He walked up to a long mirror with the ordinary\\ninstinct of his class, to pull his tie straight or to smooth his\\nhair; and there he saw the frightful figure that he was--blood\\nrunning down his face from where the bough had struck him, his hair\\nstanding out like yellow rags of rank grass, his clothes torn into\\nlong, wavering tatters.At once the whole enigma sprang up, simply\\nas the question of how he had got there, and how he was to get out\\nagain.Exactly at the same moment a man in blue, who had been\\nappointed as his valet, said very solemnly--\\n\\n\"I have put out your clothes, sir.\"\"Clothes!\"said Syme sardonically.', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('\"I have no clothes except\\nthese,\" and he lifted two long strips of his frock-coat in\\nfascinating festoons, and made a movement as if to twirl like\\na ballet girl.\"My master asks me to say,\" said the attendant, that there is a\\nfancy dress ball tonight, and that he desires you to put on the\\ncostume that I have laid out.Meanwhile, sir, there is a bottle\\nof Burgundy and some cold pheasant, which he hopes you will not\\nrefuse, as it is some hours before supper.\"\"Cold pheasant is a good thing,\" said Syme reflectively, \"and\\nBurgundy is a spanking good thing.But really I do not want either\\nof them so much as I want to know what the devil all this means,\\nand what sort of costume you have got laid out for me.', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('Where is\\nit?\"The servant lifted off a kind of ottoman a long peacock-blue\\ndrapery, rather of the nature of a domino, on the front of which\\nwas emblazoned a large golden sun, and which was splashed here\\nand there with flaming stars and crescents.\"You\\'re to be dressed as Thursday, sir,\" said the valet somewhat\\naffably.\"Dressed as Thursday!\"said Syme in meditation.', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('\"It doesn\\'t sound\\na warm costume.\"\"Oh, yes, sir,\" said the other eagerly, \"the Thursday costume is\\nquite warm, sir.It fastens up to the chin.\"\"Well, I don\\'t understand anything,\" said Syme, sighing.\"I have\\nbeen used so long to uncomfortable adventures that comfortable\\nadventures knock me out.', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('Still, I may be allowed to ask why I\\nshould be particularly like Thursday in a green frock spotted\\nall over with the sun and moon.Those orbs, I think, shine on\\nother days.I once saw the moon on Tuesday, I remember.\"\"Beg pardon, sir,\" said the valet, \"Bible also provided for you,\"\\nand with a respectful and rigid finger he pointed out a passage\\nin the first chapter of Genesis.Syme read it wondering.', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('It was\\nthat in which the fourth day of the week is associated with the\\ncreation of the sun and moon.Here, however, they reckoned from\\na Christian Sunday.\"This is getting wilder and wilder,\" said Syme, as he sat down\\nin a chair.\"Who are these people who provide cold pheasant and\\nBurgundy, and green clothes and Bibles?Do they provide\\neverything?\"', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('\"Yes, sir, everything,\" said the attendant gravely.\"Shall I help\\nyou on with your costume?\"\"Oh, hitch the bally thing on!\"said Syme impatiently.But though he affected to despise the mummery, he felt a curious\\nfreedom and naturalness in his movements as the blue and gold\\ngarment fell about him; and when he found that he had to wear a\\nsword, it stirred a boyish dream.', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('As he passed out of the room he\\nflung the folds across his shoulder with a gesture, his sword\\nstood out at an angle, and he had all the swagger of a troubadour.For these disguises did not disguise, but reveal.CHAPTER XV\\n\\nTHE ACCUSER\\n\\nAS Syme strode along the corridor he saw the Secretary standing at\\nthe top of a great flight of stairs.The man had never looked so\\nnoble.He was draped in a long robe of starless black, down the\\ncentre of which fell a band or broad stripe of pure white, like a\\nsingle shaft of light.', 'chesterton-thursday')], [(\"The whole looked like some very severe\\necclesiastical vestment.There was no need for Syme to search his\\nmemory or the Bible in order to remember that the first day of\\ncreation marked the mere creation of light out of darkness.The\\nvestment itself would alone have suggested the symbol; and Syme\\nfelt also how perfectly this pattern of pure white and black\\nexpressed the soul of the pale and austere Secretary, with his\\ninhuman veracity and his cold frenzy, which made him so easily\\nmake war on the anarchists, and yet so easily pass for one of\\nthem.Syme was scarcely surprised to notice that, amid all the\\nease and hospitality of their new surroundings, this man's eyes\\nwere still stern.No smell of ale or orchards could make the\\nSecretary cease to ask a reasonable question.\", 'chesterton-thursday')], [('If Syme had been able to see himself, he would have realised that\\nhe, too, seemed to be for the first time himself and no one else.For if the Secretary stood for that philosopher who loves the\\noriginal and formless light, Syme was a type of the poet who seeks\\nalways to make the light in special shapes, to split it up into\\nsun and star.The philosopher may sometimes love the infinite; the\\npoet always loves the finite.For him the great moment is not the\\ncreation of light, but the creation of the sun and moon.As they descended the broad stairs together they overtook\\nRatcliffe, who was clad in spring green like a huntsman, and the\\npattern upon whose garment was a green tangle of trees.', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('For he\\nstood for that third day on which the earth and green things were\\nmade, and his square, sensible face, with its not unfriendly\\ncynicism, seemed appropriate enough to it.They were led out of another broad and low gateway into a very\\nlarge old English garden, full of torches and bonfires, by the\\nbroken light of which a vast carnival of people were dancing in\\nmotley dress.Syme seemed to see every shape in Nature imitated\\nin some crazy costume.There was a man dressed as a windmill with\\nenormous sails, a man dressed as an elephant, a man dressed as a\\nballoon; the two last, together, seemed to keep the thread of\\ntheir farcical adventures.Syme even saw, with a queer thrill,\\none dancer dressed like an enormous hornbill, with a beak twice\\nas big as himself--the queer bird which had fixed itself on his\\nfancy like a living question while he was rushing down the long\\nroad at the Zoological Gardens.', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('There were a thousand other such\\nobjects, however.There was a dancing lamp-post, a dancing apple\\ntree, a dancing ship.One would have thought that the untamable\\ntune of some mad musician had set all the common objects of field\\nand street dancing an eternal jig.And long afterwards, when Syme\\nwas middle-aged and at rest, he could never see one of those\\nparticular objects--a lamppost, or an apple tree, or a windmill--\\nwithout thinking that it was a strayed reveller from that revel\\nof masquerade.On one side of this lawn, alive with dancers, was a sort of green\\nbank, like the terrace in such old-fashioned gardens.', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('Along this, in a kind of crescent, stood seven great chairs, the\\nthrones of the seven days.Gogol and Dr. Bull were already in their\\nseats; the Professor was just mounting to his.Gogol, or Tuesday,\\nhad his simplicity well symbolised by a dress designed upon the\\ndivision of the waters, a dress that separated upon his forehead\\nand fell to his feet, grey and silver, like a sheet of rain.The\\nProfessor, whose day was that on which the birds and fishes--the\\nruder forms of life--were created, had a dress of dim purple, over\\nwhich sprawled goggle-eyed fishes and outrageous tropical birds,\\nthe union in him of unfathomable fancy and of doubt.Dr. Bull, the\\nlast day of Creation, wore a coat covered with heraldic animals in\\nred and gold, and on his crest a man rampant.', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('He lay back in his\\nchair with a broad smile, the picture of an optimist in his\\nelement.One by one the wanderers ascended the bank and sat in their\\nstrange seats.As each of them sat down a roar of enthusiasm rose\\nfrom the carnival, such as that with which crowds receive kings.Cups were clashed and torches shaken, and feathered hats flung in\\nthe air.The men for whom these thrones were reserved were men\\ncrowned with some extraordinary laurels.', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('But the central chair was\\nempty.Syme was on the left hand of it and the Secretary on the right.The Secretary looked across the empty throne at Syme, and said,\\ncompressing his lips--\\n\\n\"We do not know yet that he is not dead in a field.\"Almost as Syme heard the words, he saw on the sea of human faces in\\nfront of him a frightful and beautiful alteration, as if heaven had\\nopened behind his head.But Sunday had only passed silently along\\nthe front like a shadow, and had sat in the central seat.', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('He was\\ndraped plainly, in a pure and terrible white, and his hair was like\\na silver flame on his forehead.For a long time--it seemed for hours--that huge masquerade of\\nmankind swayed and stamped in front of them to marching and\\nexultant music.Every couple dancing seemed a separate romance;\\nit might be a fairy dancing with a pillar-box, or a peasant girl\\ndancing with the moon; but in each case it was, somehow, as\\nabsurd as Alice in Wonderland, yet as grave and kind as a love\\nstory.At last, however, the thick crowd began to thin itself.Couples strolled away into the garden-walks, or began to drift\\ntowards that end of the building where stood smoking, in huge\\npots like fish-kettles, some hot and scented mixtures of old ale\\nor wine.', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('Above all these, upon a sort of black framework on the\\nroof of the house, roared in its iron basket a gigantic bonfire,\\nwhich lit up the land for miles.It flung the homely effect of\\nfirelight over the face of vast forests of grey or brown, and it\\nseemed to fill with warmth even the emptiness of upper night.Yet this also, after a time, was allowed to grow fainter; the\\ndim groups gathered more and more round the great cauldrons, or\\npassed, laughing and clattering, into the inner passages of that\\nancient house.Soon there were only some ten loiterers in the\\ngarden; soon only four.Finally the last stray merry-maker ran\\ninto the house whooping to his companions.', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('The fire faded, and\\nthe slow, strong stars came out.And the seven strange men were\\nleft alone, like seven stone statues on their chairs of stone.Not one of them had spoken a word.They seemed in no haste to do so, but heard in silence the hum of\\ninsects and the distant song of one bird.Then Sunday spoke, but\\nso dreamily that he might have been continuing a conversation\\nrather than beginning one.', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('\"We will eat and drink later,\" he said.\"Let us remain together a\\nlittle, we who have loved each other so sadly, and have fought so\\nlong.I seem to remember only centuries of heroic war, in which\\nyou were always heroes--epic on epic, iliad on iliad, and you\\nalways brothers in arms.Whether it was but recently (for time is\\nnothing), or at the beginning of the world, I sent you out to\\nwar.I sat in the darkness, where there is not any created thing,\\nand to you I was only a voice commanding valour and an unnatural\\nvirtue.', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('You heard the voice in the dark, and you never heard it\\nagain.The sun in heaven denied it, the earth and sky denied it,\\nall human wisdom denied it.And when I met you in the daylight I\\ndenied it myself.\"Syme stirred sharply in his seat, but otherwise there was silence,\\nand the incomprehensible went on.\"But you were men.', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('You did not forget your secret honour, though\\nthe whole cosmos turned an engine of torture to tear it out of\\nyou.I knew how near you were to hell.I know how you, Thursday,\\ncrossed swords with King Satan, and how you, Wednesday, named me\\nin the hour without hope.\"There was complete silence in the starlit garden, and then the\\nblack-browed Secretary, implacable, turned in his chair towards\\nSunday, and said in a harsh voice--\\n\\n\"Who and what are you?\"\"I am the Sabbath,\" said the other without moving.', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('\"I am the peace\\nof God.\"The Secretary started up, and stood crushing his costly robe in his\\nhand.\"I know what you mean,\" he cried, \"and it is exactly that that I\\ncannot forgive you.I know you are contentment, optimism, what do\\nthey call the thing, an ultimate reconciliation.Well, I am not\\nreconciled.', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('If you were the man in the dark room, why were you also\\nSunday, an offense to the sunlight?If you were from the first our\\nfather and our friend, why were you also our greatest enemy?We\\nwept, we fled in terror; the iron entered into our souls--and you\\nare the peace of God!Oh, I can forgive God His anger, though it\\ndestroyed nations; but I cannot forgive Him His peace.\"Sunday answered not a word, but very slowly he turned his face of\\nstone upon Syme as if asking a question.', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('\"No,\" said Syme, \"I do not feel fierce like that.I am grateful\\nto you, not only for wine and hospitality here, but for many a\\nfine scamper and free fight.But I should like to know.My soul\\nand heart are as happy and quiet here as this old garden, but my\\nreason is still crying out.I should like to know.\"', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('Sunday looked at Ratcliffe, whose clear voice said--\\n\\n\"It seems so silly that you should have been on both sides and\\nfought yourself.\"Bull said--\\n\\n\"l understand nothing, but I am happy.In fact, I am going to\\nsleep.\"\"I am not happy,\" said the Professor with his head in his hands,\\n\"because I do not understand.You let me stray a little too near\\nto hell.\"', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('And then Gogol said, with the absolute simplicity of a child--\\n\\n\"I wish I knew why I was hurt so much.\"Still Sunday said nothing, but only sat with his mighty chin upon\\nhis hand, and gazed at the distance.Then at last he said--\\n\\n\"I have heard your complaints in order.And here, I think, comes\\nanother to complain, and we will hear him also.\"The falling fire in the great cresset threw a last long gleam, like\\na bar of burning gold, across the dim grass.',

to the crescent of the seven and flung up his face to\\nlook at them, that Syme saw, with thunder-struck clearness, that\\nthe face was the broad, almost ape-like face of his old friend\\nGregory, with its rank red hair and its insulting smile.\"Gregory!\"', 'chesterton-thursday')], [('gasped Syme, half-rising from his seat.\"Why, this is\\nthe real anarchist!\"\"Yes,\" said Gregory, with a
